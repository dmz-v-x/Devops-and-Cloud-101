# How to Contribute to DevOps-and-Cloud-101

We welcome contributions from everyone! To ensure that your contributions are integrated smoothly, please follow the guidelines below.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting an issue:
1. **Search for existing issues** to see if your problem or suggestion has already been addressed.
2. If it’s a new issue, provide a detailed description, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable).
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
   - Any error logs or relevant details.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new tutorial, feature, or enhancement:
1. Open a new issue with the label **enhancement**.
2. Provide a detailed description of what you’re proposing and why it would improve the repository. Feel free to add relevant examples or use cases.

## Adding New Tutorials

If you’d like to add a new tutorial (for DevOps tools or AWS services), please follow these steps:
1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your tutorial (`git checkout -b tutorial-name`).
2. Create a folder for your tutorial inside the appropriate directory (e.g., `DevOps/Linux`, `AWS/EC2`, etc.).
3. Add your tutorial along with any associated resources (e.g., examples, tasks).
4. Ensure that your tutorial is clear, step-by-step, and includes any prerequisites or setup instructions.
5. **Test your tutorial** by following it yourself to make sure everything works.
6. Once your tutorial is ready, create a pull request and describe the changes you’ve made.

## Submitting Code Changes

For code changes or improvements (e.g., fixing typos, improving code examples, etc.):
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b fix-issue-name`.
3. Make your changes.
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly to ensure that they don’t break anything.
5. Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request.

Please make sure your contributions align with the overall structure of the repository (e.g., organize tutorials by topic).

## Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for this repository. If you notice any missing or unclear documentation, feel free to:
- **Add new content** or **improve existing content**.
- Update the `README.md`, `DevOps/README.md`, or any other relevant documentation to ensure it’s accurate and easy to understand.

## A Note on Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:
- Provide a **clear description** of what your PR does.
- If you’re addressing an issue, mention the issue number (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Keep your pull requests **small and focused**—one PR per feature or bugfix.
