## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
Linux is a multi-user system, meaning multiple people can use it simultaneously. To keep things organized and secure, Linux uses **users**, **groups**, and **permissions**. This guide explains everything from basic user management to advanced permissions like SUID and SGID. By the end, you’ll know how to control who can do what on a Linux system.

---

## 2. Understanding Users and Groups<a name="understanding-users-and-groups"></a>

### 2.1 What is a User?<a name="what-is-a-user"></a>
- A **user** is an entity that can log in, run programs, and own files.
- Every user has a unique **User ID (UID)**.
- Example: User `alice` has UID `1001`.

### 2.2 What is a Group?<a name="what-is-a-group"></a>
- A **group** is a collection of users. Groups simplify permission management.
- Every group has a unique **Group ID (GID)**.
- Example: Group `developers` has GID `2001`.

### 2.3 System Users vs Regular Users<a name="system-users-vs-regular-users"></a>
- **System Users**: Created for services (e.g., `www-data` for web servers). UID ranges: 0–999.
- **Regular Users**: Created for human users. UID starts at 1000+.

---

## 3. File and Directory Permissions<a name="file-and-directory-permissions"></a>

### 3.1 Permission Basics<a name="permission-basics"></a>
Every file/directory has three types of permissions:
1. **Read (r)**: View content.
2. **Write (w)**: Modify content.
3. **Execute (x)**: Run as a program.

Permissions are set for three entities:
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: Members of the file’s group.
- **Others**: Everyone else.

### 3.2 Viewing Permissions<a name="viewing-permissions"></a>
Use `ls -l` to view permissions:
```bash
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 alice developers 2048 Jan 1 10:00 report.txt
```

- -rw-r--r--: Permissions (owner: rw-, group: r--, others: r--).

- alice: Owner.

- developers: Group.

### 3.3 Changing Permissions<a name="changing-permissions"></a>
Use `chmod` to change permissions. Two methods:

1. Symbolic Notation:

   ```bash
   chmod u+x script.sh  # Add execute permission to the owner
   chmod go-w file.txt  # Remove write permission from group and others
   ```
2. Numeric Notation:

    ```bash
    chmod 755 script.sh  # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x
    ```

### 3.4 Ownership Management<a name="ownership-management"></a>

1. Change owner with chown:
    ```bash
    chown alice file.txt
    ```

2. Change group with chgrp:
    ```bash
    chgrp developers file.txt
    ```

## 4. Advanced Permissions<a name="advanced-permissions"></a>

### 4.1 SUID (Set User ID)<a name="suid"></a>

- **What it does:** A file with SUID runs with the owner’s privileges, not the user’s.

- **Example:** passwd uses SUID to modify /etc/shadow (which only root can edit).

  - **Set SUID:**
  ```bash
  chmod u+s /usr/bin/myapp
  # Numeric:
  chmod 4755 /usr/bin/myapp
  ```

### 4.2 SGID (Set Group ID)<a name="sgid"></a>

- **What it does:** Files created in a directory inherit the directory’s group.

- **Example:** Shared folder where all files belong to the group developers.

  - **Set SGID:**

  ```bash
  chmod g+s /shared_folder
  # Numeric:
  chmod 2775 /shared_folder
  ```

### 4.3 Sticky Bit<a name="sticky-bit"></a>

- **What it does:** Only the owner can delete/modify files in a directory.

- **Example:** /tmp directory.

  - **Set Sticky Bit:**

  ```bash
  chmod +t /shared
  # Numeric:
  chmod 1777 /shared
  ```

## 5. Managing Users and Groups<a name="managing-users-and-groups"></a>

### 5.1 Creating and Deleting Users<a name="creating-and-deleting-users"></a>

- **Create a user:**

    ```bash
    useradd -m -s /bin/bash alice  # -m: Create home directory
    passwd alice                   # Set password
    ```

- **Delete a user:**

    ```bash
    userdel -r alice  # -r: Remove home directory
    ```

### 5.2 Modifying Users<a name="modifying-users"></a>

- **Add user to a group:**

    ```bash
    usermod -aG developers alice  # -a: Append, -G: Supplementary groups
    ```

- **Change user’s shell:**

    ```bash
    usermod -s /bin/zsh alice
    ```

### 5.3 Creating and Deleting Groups<a name="creating-and-deleting-groups"></a>

- **Create a group:**

    ```bash
    groupadd developers
    ```

- **Delete a group:**

    ```bash
    groupdel developers
    ```

### 5.4 Modifying Groups<a name="modifying-groups"></a>

- **Change group name:**

    ```bash
    groupmod -n devs developers  # Rename "developers" to "devs"
    ```

## 6. Practical Scenarios<a name="practical-scenarios"></a>

### 6.1 Shared Folder for a Team<a name="shared-folder-for-a-team"></a>

**Goal**: Allow all members of **developers** to read/write files in **/projects.**

1. Create the group:

    ```bash
    groupadd developers
    ```

2. Add users to the group:

    ```bash
    usermod -aG developers alice
    usermod -aG developers bob
    ```

3. Set permissions:

    ```bash
    chgrp developers /projects
    chmod 2775 /projects  # SGID + rwx for group
    ```

## 6.2 Restricting Access to Sensitive Files<a name="restricting-access-to-sensitive-files"></a>

**Goal**: Ensure only **root** can read **/etc/shadow.**

```bash
$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1234 Jan 1 10:00 /etc/shadow
```

- **Permissions:** rw- for owner (root), r-- for group (shadow), --- for others.

## 7. Troubleshooting Permissions<a name="troubleshooting-permissions"></a>

- **“Permission Denied”:**

  - Check ownership (ls -l).

  - Verify group membership (groups username).

- **User can’t access a directory:**

  - Ensure the directory has x permission for the user/group.

## 8. Important Points to remember:

- **Permission String for a regular file:** `-rwxrwxrwx`
  - The first character (`-`) represents that it's a **regular file**.
  - The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the **owner's** permissions (read, write, execute).
  - The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the **group's** permissions (read, write, execute).
  - The last three characters (`rwx`) represent the **others'** permissions (read, write, execute).

- **Permission String for a directory:** `drwxrwxrwx`
  - The first character (`d`) represents that it's a **directory**.
  - The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the **owner's** permissions (read, write, execute).
  - The next three characters (`rwx`) represent the **group's** permissions (read, write, execute).
  - The last three characters (`rwx`) represent the **others'** permissions (read, write, execute).

---

- **Location where user information is stored:** `/etc/passwd`
  - This file contains basic information about all users on the system.
  - Each line in the file represents one user and includes details such as username, user ID (UID), group ID (GID), home directory, shell, and more.

- **Access Permissions:**
  - The `/etc/passwd` file is **readable by all users** (i.e., **read-only** permissions).
  - While any user can **view** the contents, only the **root user** has the permission to modify it.

- **Changing user information:**
  - **Root user** is responsible for modifying the `/etc/passwd` file (adding, deleting, or modifying user entries).
  - Users typically do not edit this file directly. Instead, they use commands like `useradd`, `usermod`, or `userdel`, which interact with this file in a controlled manner.
---

- **UID 0 is reserved for the root user:**
  - The **user identifier (UID)** of `0` is reserved for the **root user** in Unix-like systems.
  - The **root user** has the highest level of administrative privileges and can perform any action on the system, including managing files, processes, and system configurations.
  - The root user is also referred to as the **superuser** and typically has full control over the system.

- **Other UIDs:**
  - Regular users are assigned UIDs starting from 1 upwards (but typically starting from 1000 in many distributions).
  - System users (like daemon users) often have lower UIDs but are not granted the same privileges as root.
---

- **Behavior when creating a user with `adduser`:**
  - When you create a user using the `adduser` command, **by default**, a new group with the same name as the user is also created.
  - The newly created user is then assigned this group as their **primary group**.

- **Example:**
  - If you create a user named `john` with the command:
    ```bash
    sudo adduser john
    ```
  - This will create a new user `john` and also create a new group `john` (with the same name).
  - The `john` user will have `john` as their primary group, and the user will belong to this group by default.

- **Why is this done?**
  - This approach is often used to simplify user and group management, especially for managing file permissions. Each user has their own private group (commonly known as a "user-private group" or "UPG"), which can make certain file permissions easier to manage.
---

- **Password Setup for a Newly Created User:**
  - When you create a user using the `adduser` command, it **does not prompt you to enter a password by default**.
  - The user is created with no password set, and therefore, they cannot log in immediately.

- **Setting the Password Manually:**
  - After creating the user, you need to manually set the password using the `passwd` command.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    sudo passwd john
    ```
  - This will prompt you to enter a new password for the user `john`.

- **Why is this the case?**
  - This approach allows you to set the password securely after creating the user, ensuring that passwords aren't set by default in potentially insecure environments.
---

- **How to Create a New User Account:**

  1. **Using `adduser` Command:**
     - The `adduser` command is a more user-friendly way to create a new user.
     - It automatically creates the user and sets up a home directory and basic configurations.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo adduser <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user you want to create.
     - After running the command, it will prompt you to set a password and fill in some optional details (like full name, phone number, etc.).

  2. **Using `useradd` Command:**
     - The `useradd` command is a lower-level command and requires more manual configuration (it does not prompt you for a password or other information).

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m <username>
     ```
     - `-m` option ensures that a home directory is created for the new user.
     - This command does not set a password automatically, so you’ll need to use the `passwd` command to set the password afterward:
       ```bash
       sudo passwd <username>
       ```

     - **Additional Options:**
       - You can customize other options with `useradd` (e.g., setting the shell, group, etc.) by adding flags like `-s` for the shell and `-g` for the primary group.

       Example (with a custom shell and group):
       ```bash
       sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g <groupname> <username>
       ```

    - **After Creation:**
      - Once the user is created, remember to set the password using:
        ```bash
        sudo passwd <username>
        ```
      - The user will then be able to log in with the specified password
---

- **How to Create a New User with a Home Directory and Login Shell:**

  1. **Using `useradd` Command:**
     - You can use the `useradd` command with specific options to create a new user with a home directory and a login shell.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <username>
     ```
     - `-m` option: Ensures a home directory is created for the user (e.g., `/home/<username>`).
     - `-s /bin/bash` option: Specifies the login shell for the user (in this case, `/bin/bash`).
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user you want to create.

  2. **Setting the Password:**
     - After creating the user, you must manually set the password using the `passwd` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo passwd <username>
     ```
     - This will prompt you to set a password for the new user.

- **Optional Customizations:**
  - You can also specify a different shell or customize the home directory path:

    Example with a custom shell and home directory:
    ```bash
    sudo useradd -m -s /bin/zsh -d /home/customdir <username>
    ```
    - `-d /home/customdir`: Specifies a custom home directory.
    - `-s /bin/zsh`: Specifies a custom login shell (in this case, Zsh).

- **Verify User Creation:**
  - After creating the user, you can verify that the home directory and shell were set correctly by checking the `/etc/passwd` file:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd | grep <username>
    ```
---

- **How to Create a New User Account and Add to Supplementary Groups:**

  1. **Using `adduser` Command:**
     - The `adduser` command is an easy way to create a new user, and it will automatically prompt you to set a password and other details.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo adduser <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the desired username.
     - After running the command, follow the prompts to enter the password and other optional details.

     - **Adding User to Supplementary Groups:**
       - After creating the user, you can add the user to supplementary groups with the `usermod` command.

       Example:
       ```bash
       sudo usermod -aG <group1>,<group2> <username>
       ```
       - `-aG`: The `-a` option appends the user to the specified groups, and `-G` is followed by the list of groups separated by commas.
       - Replace `<group1>,<group2>` with the names of the groups you want to add the user to.
       - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user.

  2. **Using `useradd` Command:**
     - The `useradd` command is more manual but allows you to specify supplementary groups during user creation.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
     - `-m`: Ensures the user has a home directory created.
     - `-s /bin/bash`: Specifies the login shell for the user.
     - `-G <group1>,<group2>`: Specifies the supplementary groups the user should be added to.
     - Replace `<username>` with the username, and `<group1>,<group2>` with the names of the groups.

  3. **Setting the Password:**
     - After creating the user, don't forget to set a password using the `passwd` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo passwd <username>
     ```
     - This will prompt you to enter a password for the new user.

- **Verify User and Group Membership:**
  - After creating the user and adding them to supplementary groups, you can verify the groups the user belongs to with the `groups` command:

    Example:
    ```bash
    groups <username>
    ```
    - This will list the groups that the user is a member of.
---

- **How to Check the Groups a User is In:**

  1. **Using the `groups` Command:**
     - You can use the `groups` command to check which groups a specific user belongs to.

     Example:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user you want to check.
     - This will display all the groups the user is a member of, including their primary group and any supplementary groups.

  2. **Using the `id` Command:**
     - Another command to check the groups of a user is the `id` command, which shows both the user's UID, GID, and group membership information.

     Example:
     ```bash
     id <username>
     ```
     - This will output the user's UID, GID, and the list of all the groups they are part of.

  3. **Checking `/etc/group`:**
     - You can also look directly in the `/etc/group` file, which contains group information for all users.

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <username> /etc/group
     ```
     - This will display all the groups that `<username>` is listed in, by searching through the group file.

- **Output Examples:**
  - The `groups` command might return something like:
    ```bash
    username : username sudo docker
    ```
    - This means the user `username` is in the groups `username`, `sudo`, and `docker`.
---

- **How to Change the Primary Group of a User:**

  1. **Using the `usermod` Command:**
     - The `usermod` command allows you to change a user's primary group.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -g <new_group> <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_group>` with the name of the new primary group you want to assign to the user.
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user whose primary group you want to change.

  2. **Verify the Change:**
     - After changing the primary group, you can verify that the change was successful by using the `id` or `groups` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```
     - This will show the current groups the user is part of, and you should see the new primary group listed first.

     Or:
     ```bash
     id <username>
     ```
     - This will also show the user's UID, primary GID, and supplementary groups.

- **Important Notes:**
  - The new primary group must already exist. If it doesn’t, you can create it with the `groupadd` command:
    ```bash
    sudo groupadd <new_group>
    ```
  - The primary group is the group that is associated with the user’s files and permissions by default.
---

- **How to Delete a Group:**

  1. **Using the `groupdel` Command:**
     - The `groupdel` command is used to delete an existing group from the system.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo groupdel <groupname>
     ```
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the name of the group you want to delete.

  2. **Check Group Deletion:**
     - After deleting the group, you can verify that it has been removed by checking the `/etc/group` file or using the `getent` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     getent group <groupname>
     ```
     - If the group has been successfully deleted, there should be no output for that group.

  3. **Important Notes:**
     - You cannot delete a group if it is the **primary group** of any user. Before deleting the group, you must either change the primary group of any affected users using the `usermod` command, or delete the user from the group.
     - If you need to delete the user as well, you can use the `userdel` command.

- **Example of Changing Primary Group Before Deleting:**
  - If the group is the primary group of a user, change the user's primary group first:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -g <new_group> <username>
    ```
  - Then, you can delete the group using `groupdel`.
---

- **Difference Between `-G` and `-aG` Flags in `usermod`:**

  1. **`-G` (Set Supplementary Groups):**
     - The `-G` flag is used to **set supplementary groups** for a user.
     - It **replaces** the existing supplementary groups with the new list of groups specified.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -G <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
     - This command will set the user’s supplementary groups to `group1` and `group2`, **overwriting any previously assigned supplementary groups**.

  2. **`-aG` (Append to Supplementary Groups):**
     - The `-aG` flag is used to **append the user to additional groups** without removing them from any groups they are already part of.
     - This ensures that the user retains their existing supplementary groups and is added to the new ones.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
     - This command will **add the user to `group1` and `group2`**, while preserving their existing group memberships.

  3. **Key Differences:**
     - **`-G`**: **Replaces** the user’s current supplementary groups with the new list of groups.
     - **`-aG`**: **Appends** the user to the specified groups without affecting their current group memberships.

- **Why Use `-aG` Instead of `-G`?**
  - If you use `-G`, you risk removing the user from groups they were previously part of. The `-aG` option is safer when you want to **add** groups without affecting existing ones.
---

- **A User Can Only Have One Primary Group:**

  1. **What is a Primary Group?**
     - The **primary group** is the group that is associated with the user by default for file creation and other operations.
     - It is specified in the `/etc/passwd` file and is typically the user's **own group** created during user account creation (e.g., `username` as the primary group for the user `username`).

  2. **A User Can Only Have One Primary Group:**
     - Each user can only have **one primary group** at any given time.
     - This group is their default group, and it is used for file and directory ownership when the user creates new files.

  3. **Supplementary Groups:**
     - In addition to the primary group, a user can belong to **multiple supplementary groups**.
     - These supplementary groups provide additional permissions and access to resources. You can add a user to supplementary groups using the `usermod -aG` command.

  4. **Changing the Primary Group:**
     - You can change a user’s primary group using the `usermod -g` command. For example:
       ```bash
       sudo usermod -g <new_group> <username>
       ```
     - This will set `<new_group>` as the primary group for `<username>`, and the user will only have one primary group at a time.

- **Example:**
  - If the user `alice` has `alice` as the primary group and is also a member of supplementary groups `admin` and `developers`, their primary group is `alice`, and they can be added to other groups but can only have one primary group at any time.
---

- **How to Add a User to a Group While Creating the User:**

  1. **Using `useradd` Command:**
     - The `useradd` command allows you to add a user to a group at the time of user creation by using the `-G` option.
     - The `-G` option specifies supplementary groups that the user will be a member of.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
     - `-m`: Ensures that a home directory is created for the user.
     - `-s /bin/bash`: Specifies the login shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`).
     - `-G <group1>,<group2>`: Adds the user to the specified supplementary groups (`group1` and `group2` in this example).
     - Replace `<group1>,<group2>` with the group names and `<username>` with the desired username.

  2. **Using `adduser` Command (if available):**
     - The `adduser` command (more user-friendly) may also allow you to add a user to groups during user creation.
     - Some systems may prompt you to add the user to supplementary groups during the creation process.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo adduser <username>
     ```
     - After running this command, the system may ask you for additional details, including which groups to add the user to.

  3. **Setting the Primary Group:**
     - By default, the primary group of the user will be created with the same name as the username (unless specified otherwise).
     - If you want to set a specific primary group during user creation, use the `-g` option:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -g <primary_group> -G <group1>,<group2> <username>
     ```
     - `-g <primary_group>`: Specifies the primary group.

  4. **Verify Group Membership:**
     - After creating the user and adding them to the groups, you can verify their group memberships using the `groups` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```

- **Important Notes:**
  - The groups you specify with `-G` are **supplementary groups** (the user will also belong to these groups in addition to their primary group).
  - Ensure the groups already exist before assigning the user to them. You can create a group with the `groupadd` command:
    ```bash
    sudo groupadd <groupname>
    ```
---

- **How to Remove a User from a Specific Group:**

  1. **Using `gpasswd` Command:**
     - The `gpasswd` command can be used to remove a user from a group.
     - However, it’s more commonly used to manage group passwords, but it can also be used to remove a user from the group.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user you want to remove.
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the name of the group you want to remove the user from.
     - This will remove the user from the specified group while keeping the user in all other groups.

  2. **Using `usermod` Command:**
     - You can also use the `usermod` command to remove a user from a group by reconfiguring their supplementary groups.
     - The `-G` option allows you to specify the **remaining groups** the user should belong to (after removing the unwanted group).

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -G <remaining_group1>,<remaining_group2> <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<remaining_group1>,<remaining_group2>` with the groups the user should still be part of, excluding the group you want to remove them from.
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user.

     - This command **replaces** all supplementary groups, so make sure to list all groups the user should remain in, except the one being removed.

  3. **Verify the Change:**
     - After removing the user from the group, you can check their current group memberships with the `groups` or `id` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     groups <username>
     ```
     - This will show the groups the user is currently part of, and you should see that the user is no longer part of the removed group.

- **Important Notes:**
  - The user **cannot** be removed from their primary group (which is their default group when files are created).
  - If the user is the **only member** of the group, consider whether you also want to delete the group using the `groupdel` command.

- **Group Information in Linux/Unix:**

  1. **Where Group Information is Stored:**
     - The group information, such as **group name**, **group ID (GID)**, and the **list of members**, is stored in the `/etc/group` file.

  2. **Structure of `/etc/group` File:**
     - The `/etc/group` file contains a line for each group, with the following fields:
       - **Group Name**: The name of the group.
       - **Password**: Typically left empty or represented by an `x` (group passwords are rarely used).
       - **Group ID (GID)**: The unique numerical ID assigned to the group.
       - **Group Members**: A comma-separated list of usernames that belong to the group.

     Example of a line in `/etc/group`:
     ```
     admin:x:1001:alice,bob,carol
     ```
     - **`admin`**: The group name.
     - **`x`**: Placeholder for the group password (if any).
     - **`1001`**: The Group ID (GID).
     - **`alice,bob,carol`**: List of members in the group `admin`.

  3. **How to View Group Information:**
     - To view the contents of the `/etc/group` file, you can use a text editor or a command like `cat`:

     Example:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/group
     ```
     - This will display all the groups on the system and their details.

  4. **Why is Group Information Important?**
     - The `/etc/group` file helps manage user permissions and control access to system resources. It is critical for:
       - Associating users with specific groups for access control.
       - Determining which groups users are members of for file and directory permissions.

- **How to Change an Existing User's Login Shell:**

  1. **Using the `chsh` Command:**
     - The `chsh` (change shell) command is the easiest way to change a user's login shell.
     - It allows you to change the shell for the current user or any other user if you have the necessary privileges.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh <username>
     ```
     - `-s /bin/zsh`: Specifies the new login shell. Replace `/bin/zsh` with the desired shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`, `/bin/fish`, etc.).
     - `<username>`: Replace with the name of the user whose shell you want to change.

  2. **Using the `usermod` Command:**
     - The `usermod` command can also be used to change the login shell for an existing user.
     - This is useful when you need to make changes for another user, or if you want to make multiple modifications at once.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh <username>
     ```
     - `-s /bin/zsh`: Specifies the new login shell (replace `/bin/zsh` with the desired shell).
     - `<username>`: Replace with the username whose shell you want to change.

  3. **Verify the Change:**
     - After changing the login shell, you can verify the change by using the `grep` command to check the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores user account information including the login shell.

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <username> /etc/passwd
     ```
     - This will display the user's entry, including the shell at the end of the line.

     Example output:
     ```
     <username>:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/<username>:/bin/zsh
     ```
     - In this example, the user's login shell has been changed to `/bin/zsh`.

  4. **Important Notes:**
     - Ensure that the new shell is available on your system. You can check available shells by looking at the `/etc/shells` file:
       ```bash
       cat /etc/shells
       ```
     - The shell should be listed in `/etc/shells` to be considered a valid login shell.

- **Why Change a User's Login Shell?**
  - Changing a user’s login shell allows them to use a different command-line interface, which may have different features, configurations, and behavior (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish).
---

- **How to Delete a User Account:**

  1. **Using the `userdel` Command:**
     - The `userdel` command is used to delete a user account from the system.
     - By default, this command **only removes the user** and their home directory is left behind (unless specified).

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo userdel <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the name of the user you want to delete.
     - This will delete the user but **leave their home directory and files intact**.

  2. **Delete the User and Their Home Directory:**
     - If you want to **remove the user and their home directory** and files, use the `-r` option.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo userdel -r <username>
     ```
     - The `-r` option will remove the user and delete their **home directory** and **all files owned by the user**.

  3. **Verify the User Deletion:**
     - After deleting the user, you can verify that the user account has been removed by checking the `/etc/passwd` file:

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <username> /etc/passwd
     ```
     - If the user was deleted successfully, there will be no output for the user.

  4. **Important Notes:**
     - If the user is currently logged in, you may need to log them out before you can delete the account.
     - The `userdel` command **does not remove** the user’s files outside their home directory. To remove all files associated with the user, you would need to manually find and delete them, or use the `-r` flag to remove files in the home directory.
     - **Be cautious when deleting a user’s account** since this action is irreversible, especially when using the `-r` option which deletes the user’s files.

- **Deleting a User from a Specific Group (Optional):**
  - If the user is part of other groups, you may want to remove them from any additional groups before deleting the account. You can do this with the `gpasswd` or `usermod -G` command as needed.
---

- **How to Create a New Group:**

  1. **Using the `groupadd` Command:**
     - The `groupadd` command is used to create a new group on the system.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo groupadd <groupname>
     ```
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the name of the new group you want to create.
     - This will create a group with the specified name and a new unique Group ID (GID) will be automatically assigned.

  2. **Verify the Group Creation:**
     - You can verify that the group has been created by checking the `/etc/group` file, which stores group information.

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <groupname> /etc/group
     ```
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the name of the group you just created.
     - The output will show the new group’s details, including its name, GID, and members.

  3. **Important Notes:**
     - By default, the `groupadd` command will automatically assign a GID to the new group. If you want to specify a particular GID, you can use the `-g` option:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo groupadd -g 1005 <groupname>
     ```
     - Replace `1005` with the desired GID and `<groupname>` with the group name.

     - If you need to create a system group (which is typically used for system services), you can use the `-r` option:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo groupadd -r <groupname>
     ```
     - This creates a system group with a GID below 1000.

  4. **Add Users to the New Group (Optional):**
     - After creating the group, you can add users to it. To add a user to a group, you can use the `usermod` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>
     ```
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the group name and `<username>` with the user’s name.
---

- **How to Rename an Existing Group:**

  1. **Using the `groupmod` Command:**
     - The `groupmod` command is used to modify the properties of an existing group, including renaming the group.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo groupmod -n <new_groupname> <old_groupname>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_groupname>` with the desired new group name.
     - Replace `<old_groupname>` with the current name of the group you want to rename.
     - This will rename the group from `<old_groupname>` to `<new_groupname>`.

  2. **Verify the Group Renaming:**
     - After renaming the group, you can verify the change by checking the `/etc/group` file.

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <new_groupname> /etc/group
     ```
     - Replace `<new_groupname>` with the new group name.
     - The output should show the updated group with the new name and the same GID.

  3. **Important Notes:**
     - The `groupmod` command will **not change the GID** of the group. The GID will remain the same, only the group name will be updated.
     - Make sure that no processes or users are actively using the group while renaming it. It’s best to rename the group when it is not in active use to avoid any issues.
     - After renaming the group, you may need to update any file or directory permissions that are using the old group name.
---

- **How to Rename an Existing Username:**

  1. **Using the `usermod` Command:**
     - The `usermod` command can be used to rename an existing username (change the user's login name).

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -l <new_username> <old_username>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_username>` with the new desired username.
     - Replace `<old_username>` with the current username that you want to rename.
     - This will rename the user from `<old_username>` to `<new_username>`.

  2. **Rename the User's Home Directory (Optional):**
     - If you also want to rename the user's home directory to match the new username, you can use the `-d` option along with `-m` to move the home directory.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -l <new_username> -d /home/<new_username> -m <old_username>
     ```
     - This will rename the username and move the home directory from `/home/<old_username>` to `/home/<new_username>`.

  3. **Update the Username in Other System Files (Optional):**
     - After renaming the username, it’s important to check and update references to the old username in files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group`, especially if there are processes that are running under the old username.

     You can manually check and update these files, or you can use tools like `find` to search for any files owned by the old username.

  4. **Verify the Change:**
     - After renaming the username, you can verify that the change has been applied by using the `id` or `whoami` command.

     Example:
     ```bash
     id <new_username>
     ```
     - This will show the details of the user with the new username.

     - You can also check the `/etc/passwd` file to ensure the username has been updated:

     Example:
     ```bash
     grep <new_username> /etc/passwd
     ```

  5. **Important Notes:**
     - Be cautious when renaming a user, as it can affect file permissions, scheduled tasks (like cron jobs), and running processes that are using the old username.
     - It’s recommended to perform the renaming during a maintenance window or when the user is not logged in.
     - Make sure to also rename any associated groups if necessary (using the `groupmod` command), especially if the group name matches the old username.
---

- **How to Change File Ownership:**

  1. **Using the `chown` Command:**
     - The `chown` (change ownership) command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory.
     - Ownership includes the **user** and **group** associated with a file.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown <username>:<groupname> <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<username>` with the new owner of the file.
     - Replace `<groupname>` with the new group that should own the file.
     - Replace `<file_or_directory>` with the path to the file or directory.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown alice:admin file.txt
     ```
     - This will change the owner of `file.txt` to `alice` and the group to `admin`.

  2. **Change Ownership for a Directory and Its Contents:**
     - To change ownership for a directory **and all of its contents**, use the `-R` (recursive) option.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R <username>:<groupname> <directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory whose ownership you want to change.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R alice:admin /home/alice/
     ```
     - This will change the owner and group of `/home/alice/` and all files and subdirectories within it.

  3. **Changing Ownership Only for User or Group:**
     - You can also change the ownership of **only the user** or **only the group**.

     - To change just the **user** ownership:
       ```bash
       sudo chown <username> <file_or_directory>
       ```
       - This will leave the group ownership unchanged.

     - To change just the **group** ownership:
       ```bash
       sudo chown :<groupname> <file_or_directory>
       ```
       - This will leave the user ownership unchanged.

  4. **Verify Ownership Changes:**
     - You can verify that the ownership has been changed using the `ls -l` command to view file details.

     Example:
     ```bash
     ls -l <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - The output will show the file owner and group in the format:
       ```
       -rwxr-xr-x 1 alice admin 12345 Jan 27 12:00 file.txt
       ```
     - In this example, the file `file.txt` is owned by `alice` and belongs to the `admin` group.

  5. **Important Notes:**
     - Changing ownership is a critical operation, especially on files that are important for the system's operation. Make sure you are changing ownership on the correct files and directories.
     - Only users with the necessary permissions (e.g., root or the current owner) can change ownership of files.
     - The `chown` command does **not affect file permissions**. To modify permissions, use the `chmod` command.
---

- **How to Change File Ownership and Group Ownership:**

  1. **Changing the Owner of a File:**
     - To change the **owner** of a file or directory, use the `chown` command.
     - The `chown` command allows you to specify a new user to own the file.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown <new_owner> <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_owner>` with the new username who should own the file.
     - Replace `<file_or_directory>` with the path to the file or directory.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown alice file.txt
     ```
     - This will change the owner of `file.txt` to `alice`, while leaving the group unchanged.

  2. **Changing the Group Ownership of a File:**
     - To change the **group** ownership of a file, use the `chown` command with the group name preceded by a colon (`:`).
     - The group ownership can be changed without affecting the user ownership.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown :<new_group> <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_group>` with the new group that should own the file.
     - Replace `<file_or_directory>` with the path to the file or directory.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown :admin file.txt
     ```
     - This will change the group of `file.txt` to `admin`, while leaving the owner unchanged.

  3. **Changing Both Owner and Group of a File:**
     - You can change both the **owner** and **group** at the same time using the `chown` command with both the username and group name.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown <new_owner>:<new_group> <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<new_owner>` with the new user who should own the file.
     - Replace `<new_group>` with the new group that should own the file.
     - Replace `<file_or_directory>` with the path to the file or directory.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown alice:admin file.txt
     ```
     - This will change the owner of `file.txt` to `alice` and the group to `admin`.

  4. **Change Ownership Recursively for Directories:**
     - To change ownership for a directory and all files within it, use the `-R` (recursive) option.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R <new_owner>:<new_group> <directory>
     ```
     - Replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory you want to change the ownership for.

     Example:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R alice:admin /home/alice/
     ```
     - This will change the owner and group of `/home/alice/` and all files and subdirectories within it.

  5. **Verify the Changes:**
     - After changing the ownership or group, you can verify the changes using the `ls -l` command:

     Example:
     ```bash
     ls -l <file_or_directory>
     ```
     - The output will show the file’s owner and group in the format:
       ```
       -rwxr-xr-x 1 alice admin 12345 Jan 27 12:00 file.txt
       ```
     - In this example, the file `file.txt` is owned by `alice` and belongs to the `admin` group.

  6. **Important Notes:**
     - Changing ownership or group ownership is a critical action that can affect access permissions, especially on system files or files shared among users. Be careful when using `chown`.
     - You need superuser (root) privileges to change ownership of files that are not owned by your current user.
     - Changing ownership on directories will affect all files within them if you use the recursive `-R` option.

## 9. Best Practices<a name="best-practices"></a>
- Use groups to manage permissions, not individual users.

- Avoid giving 777 permissions (use 755 or 750 instead).

- Regularly audit users/groups with cat /etc/passwd and cat /etc/group.
