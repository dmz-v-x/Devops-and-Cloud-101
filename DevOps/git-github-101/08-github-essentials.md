2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name and description.
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** visibility.
5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README** if desired.
6. Click **Create repository**.

Your repository is now ready to be used!

## Connecting Local Repositories to GitHub

To sync a local Git repository with GitHub, use the `git remote` command.

### Steps:
1. Create or navigate to your local Git repository.
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote.
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
3. Push your code to GitHub.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Now your local repository is connected to GitHub!

## Working with GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions is a built-in automation tool for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

### Steps to Set Up GitHub Actions:
1. Navigate to your repository and click **Actions**.
2. Click **New Workflow** or create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project.
3. Add a YAML file, e.g., `ci.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: CI Pipeline
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run a script
           run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
   ```
4. Commit and push the file.
5. GitHub will automatically trigger the workflow on new commits.

GitHub Actions help automate testing, deployment, and other tasks efficiently.
