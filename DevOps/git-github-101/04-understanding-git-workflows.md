## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. This guide will deep dive into Git commands, their inner workings, and how they affect your repository.

## Git Basics: The Three States

Before we dive into commands, it's crucial to understand Git's three main states:

1. **Working Directory**
   - This is your local filesystem where you edit files
   - Contains all project files and directories
   - Git monitors this area for changes but doesn't track them automatically

2. **Staging Area (Index)**
   - A intermediate database for changes you want to commit
   - Located in `.git/index`
   - Acts as a preview of your next commit

3. **Repository (.git directory)**
   - Contains all committed changes
   - Stores complete history and metadata
   - Located in `.git` folder

## Git Commands in Detail

### 1. Repository Setup Commands

#### `git init`
```bash
git init
```
**What it does:**
- Creates a new `.git` directory in your current folder
- Sets up the initial branch (usually named 'main' or 'master')
- Creates necessary subdirectories:
  - `/objects` (stores all content)
  - `/refs` (stores pointers to commits)
  - `/HEAD` (points to current branch)

#### `git clone [url]`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git custom-folder
```
**What it does:**
- Creates a copy of a remote repository locally
- Sets up remote tracking automatically
- Creates all branches from remote
- Checks out the default branch

**Internal workflow:**
1. Creates a directory for the project
2. Initializes `.git` directory
3. Downloads all repository data
4. Creates remote references
5. Checks out working copy

### 2. Basic Configuration Commands

#### `git config`
```bash
# Global configuration
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Repository-specific configuration
git config user.name "Your Name"

# List all configurations
git config --list

# Edit configuration file directly
git config --global --edit
```
**What it does:**
- Stores configuration in three locations:
  1. System level: `/etc/gitconfig`
  2. Global level: `~/.gitconfig`
  3. Repository level: `.git/config`
- Each level overrides the previous one

### 3. Basic Workflow Commands

#### `git status`
```bash
git status
git status -s  # Short format
git status -b  # Show branch information
```
**What it does:**
- Reads the index file
- Compares index with working directory
- Compares index with HEAD commit
- Shows:
  - Current branch
  - Tracked/untracked files
  - Modified files
  - Staged changes

#### `git add`
```bash
# Add specific file
git add file.txt

# Add all files
git add .

# Add files interactively
git add -p

# Add files by pattern
git add "*.txt"
```
**What it does:**
1. Calculates file's SHA-1 hash
2. Creates blob object in `.git/objects`
3. Updates index with new content
4. Stages file for commit

**Internal workflow:**
1. Reads file content
2. Creates blob object
3. Updates staging area
4. Maintains file mode and timestamp

#### `git commit`
```bash
# Basic commit
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Add and commit tracked files
git commit -am "Update files"

# Amend previous commit
git commit --amend

# Create signed commit
git commit -S -m "Signed commit"
```
**What it does:**
1. Creates a new commit object containing:
   - Author and committer information
   - Timestamp
   - Commit message
   - Tree object (snapshot of staged files)
   - Parent commit reference(s)

**Internal workflow:**
1. Creates tree object from index
2. Creates commit object
3. Updates HEAD and branch reference
4. Clears staging area

### 4. Branch Operations

#### `git branch`
```bash
# List branches
git branch
git branch -a  # List all branches (including remote)
git branch -v  # Show last commit on each branch

# Create branch
git branch feature-branch

# Delete branch
git branch -d feature-branch
git branch -D feature-branch  # Force delete
```
**What it does:**
- Creates/deletes/lists references in `.git/refs/heads/`
- Updates symbolic references
- Manages branch tracking information

#### `git checkout`
```bash
# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name

# Create and switch
git checkout -b new-branch

# Checkout specific commit
git checkout commit-hash

# Checkout file from different branch
git checkout branch-name -- file.txt
```
**What it does:**
1. Updates HEAD to point to new branch/commit
2. Updates working directory to match target
3. Resets index to match target

**Internal workflow:**
1. Validates checkout target
2. Updates HEAD reference
3. Updates index
4. Updates working directory

### 5. Remote Operations

#### `git remote`
```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Show remote details
git remote -v
git remote show origin

# Remove remote
git remote remove origin
```
**What it does:**
- Manages remote repository references
- Stores configurations in `.git/config`
- Maintains fetch and push URLs

#### `git fetch`
```bash
# Fetch from specific remote
git fetch origin

# Fetch all remotes
git fetch --all

# Fetch specific branch
git fetch origin branch-name
```
**What it does:**
1. Downloads objects and refs from remote
2. Updates remote-tracking branches
3. Does NOT modify working directory

**Internal workflow:**

2. Merges/rebases fetched changes
3. Updates working directory

**Internal workflow:**
1. Fetches remote changes
2. Identifies merge base
3. Performs merge/rebase
4. Updates working directory

#### `git push`
```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Push all branches
git push --all origin

# Force push (use carefully!)
git push -f origin main
```
**What it does:**
1. Uploads local objects to remote
2. Updates remote references
3. Updates remote HEAD if needed

**Internal workflow:**

2. Computes necessary objects
3. Transfers objects
4. Updates remote references

### 6. Advanced Operations

#### `git rebase`
```bash
# Basic rebase
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Continue after resolving conflicts
git rebase --continue
```
**What it does:**
1. Identifies common ancestor
2. Creates temporary area for changes
3. Applies commits one by one
4. Updates branch reference

**Internal workflow:**
1. Saves current branch state
2. Resets to target branch
3. Applies commits sequentially
4. Handles conflicts as needed

#### `git merge`
```bash
# Merge branch
git merge feature-branch

4. Updates working directory

## Collaboration Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/new-feature main

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature implementation"

# Update from main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Push feature
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. Pull Request Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/enhancement

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement enhancement"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/enhancement

# After review and approval
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/enhancement
git push origin main
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages
```bash
# Good commit message structure
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication

- Add login form component
- Implement JWT token handling
- Add password encryption
- Set up user session management"
```

### 2. Branch Management
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth main

# Keep branch updated
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Clean up after merge
git branch -d feature/user-auth
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Fixing Mistakes
```bash
# Undo last commit
git reset --soft HEAD^

# Undo staged changes
git reset HEAD file.txt

# Discard local changes
git checkout -- file.txt

# Remove untracked files
git clean -fd
```

### 2. Recovering Lost Work
```bash
# View reflog
git reflog

# Recover deleted branch
git checkout -b recovered-branch HEAD@{1}

# Recover lost commit
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```
