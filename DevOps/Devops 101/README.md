# DevOps 101

Welcome to **DevOps 101**! This folder provides a foundational introduction to **DevOps**—a culture, set of practices, and philosophy that aims to integrate development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. This section will help you understand what DevOps is, why it is important, and how it can transform software development and IT operations.

In this section, we will cover the following topics:
